/// A model representing a notification sound option for Islamic prayer notifications.
///
/// This immutable data class encapsulates information about available notification
/// sounds that users can select for prayer time alerts and Islamic reminders.
/// It includes both the display name for user interface and the technical
/// file name for audio playback.
///
/// The model supports various types of notification sounds including:
/// - Traditional Islamic call to prayer (Adhan) in different styles
/// - Simple notification tones for discrete alerts
/// - Regional variations of Adhan from different Islamic traditions
/// - Custom sounds for different prayer times or reminder types
///
/// This is used in sound selection interfaces where users can preview
/// and choose their preferred notification audio for prayer times.
