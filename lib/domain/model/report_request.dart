/// A model representing a user report or feedback request.
///
/// This immutable data class encapsulates information needed to submit
/// user reports, bug reports, feedback, or support requests within the
/// Islam Mob app. It supports both textual content and file attachments
/// to provide comprehensive reporting capabilities.
///
/// The model includes:
/// - **Required textual content** describing the issue or feedback
/// - **Optional file attachments** for screenshots, logs, or supporting documents
/// - **Multiple attachment support** for comprehensive issue documentation
///
/// This is used in help and support features where users can report
/// issues, provide feedback, or request assistance with app functionality.
/// The attachment support allows users to include visual evidence or
/// additional context for their reports.

  /// - [attach1]: Optional first file attachment (screenshot, document, etc.)
  /// - [attach2]: Optional second file attachment for additional context
