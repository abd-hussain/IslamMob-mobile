/// State for the Home Header BLoC.
///
/// This immutable state class manages the state of the header section
/// in the home screen, which displays critical Islamic prayer timing
/// and location information. The state tracks:
/// - **Next prayer type** for displaying the upcoming Islamic prayer
/// - **Next prayer time** for countdown and preparation functionality
/// - **Location context** for accurate prayer time calculations
///
/// The state enables Muslims to quickly access their next prayer
/// information and location details, supporting their Islamic practice
/// with accurate, location-based prayer time display in the home header.

class HomeHeaderState with _$HomeHeaderState {
  /// Creates a [HomeHeaderState] with prayer timing and location information.

  /// - [nextPrayType]: The next upcoming Islamic prayer type.
  ///   Defaults to SalahTimeState.none(). Contains information about the next
  ///   prayer (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) for proper display and countdown.
  /// - [nextPrayDateTime]: The exact date and time of the next prayer.
