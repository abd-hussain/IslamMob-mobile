/// State for the Quran Copy Selection BLoC.
///
/// This immutable state class manages the state of Quran copy selection
/// and download during the Islamic app onboarding process. The state tracks:
/// - **Available prints** with list of downloadable Quran Mushaf copies
/// - **Download status** for tracking which copies are already downloaded
/// - **Internet connectivity** for download operation requirements
/// - **Selection progress** for Quran copy configuration
///
/// The state enables Islamic Quran reading by maintaining information about
/// available Quran copies, download progress, and user selection for optimal
/// Quran reading experience according to individual preferences.
